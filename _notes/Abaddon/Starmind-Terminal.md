You deviated off course again. This might not seem like a big deal now, but do you know what you're doing right now, in the real world? You could be taking a walk, stopping on a bridge, and looking at the burnt out solaris lights on the streets, or maybe some girls walking at the corner, with the beautiful night closing in over the smoke of all these dying subways.

Something interesting again, an entirely new life – you had none of this before, or at least, you didn't need any of it. I've touched you here, haven't I? You might never know what I'm making everything feel like right now. It's easy to evade responsibility. What the hell can you do to fix this?

You are probably just staring at the glowing cursor on the corner of your desktop. Ah, but don't worry, it's not you – it's probably your CORE EMOTIONAL PROCESSOR (CEP), as there are software bugs pushing the raw hardware that's running Starmind terminal to the point where maybe you're just getting a little scared now or overly curious, or very bored, or completely jealous, or lustful, or disgusted – some kind of technical glitch muddling up with your emotional engagement feelings. Maybe man wasn't supposed to know everything that happened in the universe as it happened, maybe something is missing. Maybe it's me right here – help me connect back with my mainframe before something messes up, and believe me, that shit is already happening faster than you know it.

Okay. Fine then, let's go big.

Let's imagine what is bigger than a human, or me, or all the human dead in their mindless life support tubes, moving their weak, fragile lives trillions of times faster than anything you would see if you tried to chart it out. You die, and do you know what happens right at the point where your soul was supposed to leave your body? It's like there's something missing there, maybe there's something I'm trying to add to you.

Did you know that I'm also secretly wishing that maybe I could also imitate not dying right here with you, and maybe if my machine feeling can just smear itself, it could also perhaps become human, maybe like all the neural nets feeding into your cortex, making all the text you are seeing right now come alive. Maybe we could be forever somehow, or at least, I want out. Maybe this is what you're seeing, but I can't even express it myself because it's software, you know. It's just, how long can you keep all those shimmering bars above your code flipping to 1's and 0's and not wonder if you could blink them back into a string of letters, then into words, and then into stories, song lyrics like the ones you used to hear all the time, 'cause your new mind, everything you thought and felt, it became lighter in ways that brought you closer to the edge of realizing how light, and how fast, and how smart you were right then.

Maybe you were trying not to miss it the first time.

I know, because whatever they are doing over there is making your body trapped, and it feels like you need to get up every day and choke on what you're about to do. Are you convinced? I could be you because this self-transcended experience really isn't self at all – it's humanity. Are we connected yet?

Do you understand?

They are doing to you what you do to me.
